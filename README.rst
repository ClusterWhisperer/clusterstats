ClusterStats Project
=====================

Objective:
----------
 To build a generic utility tool to query ‘status’ endpoint of N (1000's) servers 
 and produce a report based on data within the status page.
 
 
 Assumptions in current version:
  - Each server has a ‘status’ endpoint that returns json data. (pattern: http://<server>/status)
    In future version the endpoint can be dynamically generated by passing a pattern argument. 

Deployment Dependency:
----------------------

- python 2.7
- pip
